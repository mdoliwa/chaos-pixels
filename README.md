# ChaosPixels

ChaosPixels is a project I've always wanted to do. It's a simple site at [ChaosPixels.com](https://chaospixels.com) that changes every day. We pick the top-voted PR from users, merge it, and update the site.

## How It Works
Users submit pull requests (PRs) to modify the website's source code in the `src` directory. Others show their support by leaving a 👍 reaction on the initial comment of the PR. At the end of each day, I sum up the votes, and the PR with the highest score is merged and deployed. After that, I close all open PRs and we start the next day.

Each 👍 is initially worth one point. You can [increase the impact of your vote by buying a boost](https://buy.stripe.com/28o6q4fjD2Uj7fi7ss), each $1 you spend adds +1 to your voting power, and this enhancement does not expire.

## What's the Point?

There are a couple of reasons why I started this:

1. I'm fascinated by how simple rules can create complex and unpredictable results. It's exciting to see where this experiment goes.
2. Exploring ways to make money online, and this project might just be the golden ticket with some Saudi Arabia prince buying $1 million boost to make sure his PR is merged. Who knows? :)

## Is Anything Allowed in PRs?

Yes, with a few important exceptions. We welcome creative and innovative contributions, but please steer clear of anything illegal, pornographic, or related to gambling. It's all about maintaining a positive vibe and building something cool together.

Now, let's spread some chaos! :)
